introduction =  A week ago, an unusual solar activity destroyed space navigation systems\n\
                and life-support devices on multiple spaceships, stranding astronauts\n\
                across the solar system. You have detected multiple SOS beacons.\n\
                A former Space Force Astronaut Carl Walker Jr. receives a call from NASA.\n\
                He is asked to do his one last dance: a search and rescue mission.\n\
                Given the urgency of the situation, the international community\n\
                manages to cooperate and quickly construct one special spacecraft.\n\
                But time is not on Walker\'s side.\n\
                Colonel Walker must rescue every stranded astronaut and safely bring them home\n\
                before fuel runs out or the ship becomes to badly damaged.\n\
                NASA expects Colonel Walker to bring back every astronaut or die trying.

help = The goal of the game is pick up astronauts that have become stranded on distant astral bodies.\n\
       You must load the astronauts onto your ship and unload them onto Earth.\n\ \n\
       Beware: \n\ Your spaceship has limited fuel and cargo capacity, you must travel quickly! \n\
       It is possible for your ship to become damaged during your travels. \n\
       If you have an engineer on board, they can repair your ship. \n\
       Fly you fool! Their lives depend upon you.
