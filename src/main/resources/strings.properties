introduction = A week ago, an unusual solar activity destroyed space navigation systems,\n\
               and life-support devices on multiple spaceships, stranding astronauts, on the\n\
               Moon, Mars, and Mercury. A former Space Force Astronaut Carl Walker Jr. receives a\n\
               call from NASA. He is asked to do his one last dance: a Search and Rescue mission.\n\
               Given the urgency of the situation, the international community\n\
               manages to cooperate and quickly construct one special spacecraft.\n\
               But time is not on Walker's side. Colonel Walker must rescue every stranded \n\
               astronaut, and safely bring them home in just one trip.\n\
               NASA expects Colonel Walker to bring back at least 4/5 (four-fifths)\n\
               of the stranded astronauts (overpopulation, sorry).
